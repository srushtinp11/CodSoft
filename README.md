# Data Science Internship at CodSoft
This repository contains the work I've been involved with during my Data Science internship at CodSoft. My internship focuses on applying data science techniques to solve real-world problems, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning. I have worked on projects related to data preprocessing, building machine learning models, and performing exploratory data analysis using Python and various libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This repository showcases my hands-on experience in data science and my contributions to the CodSoft team.
